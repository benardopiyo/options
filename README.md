# Options 

* The `Options` program is designed to handle command-line arguments as options, represented by characters following a dash (-). 
* Each valid option corresponds to a bit in an integer value, and these options are grouped and displayed as bits. 


## Instructions

* **Input:** The program takes an undefined number of command-line arguments. These arguments represent options, where each option begins with a - followed by one or more characters from the set abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.

* **Output:** The program should output the bit representation of the options in groups of bytes, each group representing a character from - to z.
